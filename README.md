- ⚡ Fun fact: >> The first computer bug was literally a *bug*! In 1947, while working on the Harvard Mark II computer, engineers found that a moth had gotten trapped in one of the machine's relays, causing a malfunction. They removed the moth and "debugged" the computer. The term "bug" has since been used to refer to software glitches or errors.
